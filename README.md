## 📦 About Me

I'm a **cybersecurity professional** with a deep passion for exploring digital systems, identifying vulnerabilities, and building secure applications. My expertise spans across penetration testing (both black-box and white-box approaches), security auditing for web and mobile applications, light reverse engineering, and developing custom security tooling.

## Mission Statement

> _To bridge the gap between offensive security research and defensive implementations, creating more resilient digital ecosystems through education, automation, and ethical hacking._

## Technical Specializations

### Offensive Security & Pentesting

* **Web Application Security**: Comprehensive testing against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, API security assessments, and modern web infrastructure auditing
* **Network Penetration Testing**: TCP/UDP service enumeration, VPN security assessments, LDAP/SMB protocol analysis, and enterprise network architecture reviews
* **Social Engineering**: Authorized phishing campaigns, physical security testing, and human factor vulnerability assessments
* **Red Teaming**: Advanced TTPs (Tactics, Techniques & Procedures), lateral movement strategies, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation frameworks

## Current Projects & Activities

### CTF Competitions

* Regularly participating in international CTF competitions
* Specializing in **web exploitation**, **digital forensics**, and **reverse engineering** challenges
* Maintaining a repository of write-ups and solution methodologies

### Tool Development

* Building an open-source penetration testing automation framework
* Creating educational resources for aspiring security professionals
