### 📦 About Me

I'm a **cybersecurity professional** with a deep passion for exploring digital systems, identifying vulnerabilities, and building secure applications. My expertise spans across penetration testing (both black-box and white-box approaches), security auditing for web and mobile applications, light reverse engineering, and developing custom security tooling.

#### Mission Statement
> *"To bridge the gap between offensive security research and defensive implementations, creating more resilient digital ecosystems through education, automation, and ethical hacking."*

#### Technical Specializations

**Offensive Security & Pentesting:**
  * **Web Application Security**: Comprehensive testing against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, API security assessments, and modern web infrastructure auditing
  * **Network Penetration Testing**: TCP/UDP service enumeration, VPN security assessments, LDAP/SMB protocol analysis, and enterprise network architecture reviews
  * **Social Engineering**: Authorized phishing campaigns, physical security testing, and human factor vulnerability assessments
  * **Red Teaming**: Advanced TTPs (Tactics, Techniques & Procedures), lateral movement strategies, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation frameworks

#### Current Projects & Activities

**CTF Competitions:**
  * Regularly participating in international CTF competitions
  * Specializing in **web exploitation**, **digital forensics**, and **reverse engineering** challenges
  * Maintaining a repository of write-ups and solution methodologies

**Tool Development:**
  * Building an open-source penetration testing automation framework
  * Developing custom payload generators and C2 (Command & Control) infrastructure
  * Creating educational resources for aspiring security professionals

**Security Research:**
  * Analyzing emerging malware families and exploit techniques
  * Researching evasion techniques and anti-forensic methods
  * Contributing to security communities through blog posts and conference talks
