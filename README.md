## About Me

I'm a **cybersecurity professional** with a deep passion for exploring digital systems, identifying vulnerabilities, and building secure applications. My expertise spans across penetration testing (both black-box and white-box approaches), security auditing for web and mobile applications, light reverse engineering, and developing custom security tooling.
